Recursive descent parser, straight-forward part 1. No math rules like * before +,
so the evaluation is really simple.

For part two, evaluate both terms in the root equation, select the one that has an answer.
Try to use back-propagation to make the other term equal to it.

Sounds obvious, but no joy.

Can't find the problem with this back-propagation method.  The answer appears to be
a very large number, on the order of 1e14.

Plan B:

Take a huge range (like 1e10 to 1e16) and plug in the values for humn.
Evaluate in 10 steps, find the interval where the answer goes from negative to positive
-- it must cross zero somewhere in that interval.
Divide the new interval into 10 steps and repeat until we find the zero.
